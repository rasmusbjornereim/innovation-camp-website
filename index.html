                    <h1>The Problem</h1>
                    <p><strong>Good education</strong> is one of the United Nations sustainability goal`s.
                        This is very important for all children across the world, but is critical for children
                        In sub-Sahara Africa. These children have the highest rate of absenteeism.
                        Based on numbers from UIS and UNESCO about 60% or almost
                        100 million of children between 12-17 years is outside of school. Why is this?

                    <h1>Why?</h1>
                    <p>
                        There are many reasons as to why many children in Africa are out of school,
                        and many are connected. Poverty, bad infrastructure and the school's quality are central problems.
                        Because of this many families donâ€™t prioritize school because <strong>the children are more needed at home.</strong>
                        Where work can be done to feed the family.
                        Does it have to be that way?

                    <p>
                        <strong>The idea is a reward system.</strong><br>
                        Based on the absentee data from each school we will provide a targeted reward to the
                        school itself or the community around it. The schools gather data on paper,
                        which is regularly collected and sent to a central office. The data is digitised and analysed.
                        When the school has made a benchmark they receive the reward.
                        This system will detect a problem in the local community and provide a solution to that problem.<br><br>
                        When people see that there is a direct link between the children attending school and a better life,
                        every child will have the opportunity to attend school.
